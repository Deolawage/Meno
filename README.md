## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v18 or higher
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account with a new project
- A [Railway](https://railway.app) account (for deployment)

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/meno-app.git
cd meno-app
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create your Supabase database
1. Create a new Supabase project.
2. Open the SQL editor and run the migration in `supabase/schema.sql`.
3. Copy your project URL and anon/service keys from the Supabase dashboard.

The schema creates private `course-files` and `chat-files` Storage buckets. Course documents, chat attachments, and voice notes are uploaded through the authenticated server and are not stored on the application filesystem.
4. In Supabase **Authentication → URL Configuration**, set the Site URL to
   `http://localhost:3000` while developing. Add `http://localhost:3000/**` to the
   Redirect URLs list, then add the production URL and its callback path before deployment.
5. To enable Google sign-in:
   - In Google Cloud Console, create an OAuth Web application.
   - Add `http://localhost:3000` under Authorized JavaScript origins.
   - Add `https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` under Authorized redirect URIs.
   - In Supabase **Authentication → Providers → Google**, enable Google and paste the
     Google client ID and client secret.
   - Restart Klasora and use **Continue with Google**. Supabase returns the provider session
     to `APP_URL`, where Klasora exchanges it for its protected application session.
6. For registration verification and password reset emails, configure Supabase
   **Authentication → SMTP Settings** for production. Keep the default Supabase email
   service for local testing only, then verify the email templates link back to
   `APP_URL` and test both flows from the login screen.

### 4. Set up environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your values:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
JWT_SECRET=your_random_secret_here
PORT=3000

# Optional - for AI assistant
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
# Optional model override
# GROQ_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-20b

# Optional - for push notifications
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapid_public_key
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_vapid_private_key
VAPID_EMAIL=mailto:you@example.com
```

### 5. Run locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and go to **http://localhost:3000**.

   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `APP_URL`
   - `JWT_SECRET`
7. Go to **Settings**, then **Domains**, then **Generate Domain**

Course spaces are private by default. A course owner creates the space and can invite
existing Klasora users by email from the course management flow.
